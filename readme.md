- The `challenge` folder includes the resulting files required to run the challenge and additional supporting files. These include a slide deck with detailed instructions.

## Requirements

The challenge is designed to run in a Google Colab environment.
- Part one [open in colab]: basic data loading functions and features to get started.
- Part two [open in colab]: example hate speech classifier and evaluation instruments to conduct example-based bias assessments of the proposed models.

Preparation notebooks and scripts are run in a Conda environment in Python 3.10.
